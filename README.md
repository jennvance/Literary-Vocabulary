I didn't read much fiction in my 20's. Instead I enjoyed a wide variety of nonfiction, from autobiography to science to how-to books. A nonfiction author I enjoyed, Natalie Goldberg who is an expert on the topic of writing, mentioned that Cormac McCarthy was one of her favorite authors. So when I found a Cormac McCarthy book on the shelf in my apartment complex's free library, I borrowed it.

Side note: if your apartment complex doesn't keep a library for its residents, don't live there (to bastardize a John Waters quote)...or at least, convince the management to create one.

Cormac McCarthy's Child of God was the first fiction book I'd read in a decade. I'll admit the plot itself was vulgar, horrifying, and so offensive I might have thrown the book in the trash if it weren't for the extraordinary beauty of the language in which McCarthy wrote it. I had never seen sentences crafted that way. I had never encountered such music, such subtlety, such perfect craftsmanship right there on the page.

I had also never torn a page clean out of a book before. One passage was so grotesque, so vivid and repulsive that I ripped the page out of the book, crumpled it, and threw it in the trash to ensure I would never read it again. Of course, this had the effect of burning the words so clearly into memory that I do not need the forsaken page to remind me what it said. I will not repeat it here. You should read the book yourself.

After I finished Child of God I set out to read Cormac McCarthy's entire body of work. At present I'm two and a half books shy of completing this goal. 

Cormac McCarthy uses a rich vocabulary of words that even the most voracious lover of English may not recognize. As I read his books I found myself writing them down for sheer curiosity. But looking them up once was not enough to learn their meaning and usage to the extent that I might someday implement them as naturally as McCarthy does.

I thought about creating flashcards that I could refer to. Then, in October 2020 I participated in Digital Ocean's HacktoberFest and made my first contributions to open source documentation. Following that, I read an open source book for the first time, Brian Dominick's [Codewriting](https://github.com/briandominick/codewriting), which among other things taught me that open source need not be limited to the field of technology. Open source can actually be a useful tool for a variety of fields including creative writing. I decided that I would create an open source project to document and honor Cormac McCarthy's rich contributions to literature.

At the moment the project contains words only from Cormac McCarthy's works. But I foresee the repository eventually containing vocabulary from a wide variety of classics. Perhaps this project can serve creative writers by expanding their vocabulary while also introducing them to the world of open source.

I am not yet asking for contributions, but will at a later date. At that time I will create a Contributions file containing instructions for collaboration.

I hope you find Cormac McCarthy's vocabulary as rich, beautiful, and awe-inspiring as I do.
